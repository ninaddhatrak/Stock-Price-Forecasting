## ü§ñ Model Performance and Experience

In developing this project, I experimented with three different models: **LSTM**, **ARIMA**, and **Prophet**. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of my experience with each:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: This model performed the best for stock price prediction. Its ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data made it highly effective for forecasting stock trends. The predictions were more accurate and aligned well with actual stock movements.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: While ARIMA is a classic time-series model, I found it less effective for stock price prediction. It struggled to capture the complexity and volatility of stock market data, often resulting in less accurate forecasts.

- **Prophet**: Developed by Facebook, Prophet is designed for time-series forecasting with a focus on simplicity. However, I found it less suitable for stock market data, as it often oversimplified trends and failed to account for sudden market fluctuations.

**Conclusion**: Based on my experience, **LSTM** is the more reliable model for stock price prediction, while ARIMA and Prophet were less effective for this specific use case.
